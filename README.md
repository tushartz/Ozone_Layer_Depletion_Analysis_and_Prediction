# Ozone_Layer_Depletion_Analysis_and_Prediction
Introduction
The emission of ozone-depleting gases impacted the earth’s ozone layer – a layer that absorbs most of the Sun’s ultraviolet radiation. Emissions were increasing rapidly until the 1980s.
The primary concern of the ‘ozone hole’ has been its impact on the quantity of UV-B radiation reaching Earth’s surface.
When chlorine and bromine atoms come into contact with ozone in the stratosphere, they destroy ozone molecules. One chlorine atom can destroy over 100,000 ozone molecules before it is removed from the stratosphere. Ozone can be destroyed more quickly than it is naturally created.
Ozone layer protection from UV-B irradiation is critical to the health of many lifeforms, including human health.
Since then the world has achieved rapid progress: the near-elimination of ozone-depleting substances and the trend towards recovery of the ozone layer are arguably among the most successful international environmental collaborations to date.
We are  analyzing and doing time series forecasting on it
To predict we need the detailed data and information of the total ozone present in Dobson Units.
To get detailed data we have to extract data from images present in Website (https://ozonewatch.gsfc.nasa.gov) with help of python.
Then the Image processing  & Time series forecasting comes into picture to predict the future outcomes using machine learning algorithms.
